# Day04Python
## Today I learnt all about;
## Randomisation and Pyhton List
## I also worked on a project of creating a rock, paper and scissor game. The players are; you and a computer. 
## Using randomisation we get a number between 0 and 2 with that and the input of the player we play and check for the winner!
